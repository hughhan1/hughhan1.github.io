        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Hugh.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate from Johns Hopkins University where I studied computer science and
          applied mathematics. Before my current job at Dropbox, I had a gig doing business
          development in London and Copenhagen.

          I previously worked on a few open source projects: most notably a{' '}

        <p>
          I love photography, journaling, and late-romantic classical music. In my free time I like
          to dance, read, shoot photos and videos, and play (what I think is) a mean game of Super
          Smash Bros Melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some additional things that make me happy.
          <ul>
            <li>mediocrely taken photographs of fond memories</li>
            <li>well yet concisely documented code</li>

          few things in life that I find as beautiful as meaningful connections with other people.
