        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Hugh.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate from Johns Hopkins University where I studied computer science and
          applied mathematics. Before my current job at Dropbox, I had a gig doing business
          development in London and Copenhagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love photography, journaling, and late-romantic classical music. I'm a proponent of
          open-source software; I've previously worked on a{' '}

          . In my free time I like to dance, read, shoot photos and videos, and play (what I think
          is) a mean game of Super Smash Bros Melee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some additional things that make me happy.
          <ul>
            <li>photographs of fond memories</li>
            <li>friends</li>
          </ul>

          If you want to get to know me, please <Link to="/contact/">reach out</Link>! There are so
          few things in life that I find as beautiful as meaningful connections with other people.
